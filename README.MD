# website
The \_blank website

## Contributing
Create a PR if you have some valuable changes with commit self explanatory.  
HTML in the root directory and css in /css should not be modified directly.  
They are generated by _includes_ and _styles_ gulp tasks respectively.

## Building
In project repository : run `gulp` (then modify scss sources, html and javascript).

### Gulp tasks
 - _styles_ : compile scss files into css  
 - _includes_ : run inclusion of fragments in /fragments into pages in /pages, and writes the result to the root directory.  
 - _default_ : watches changes and run either _styles_ or _includes_ depending on the modified sources.  

##Â Release
To release the website, copy all HTML files in the root directory + _css_ , _fonts_, _js_  and _images_ folders to the target directory.
TODO EOS : make a gulp task to put all content in a specific directory, ingored from git.
